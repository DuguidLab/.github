# Duguid Lab

Welcome to the Duguid Lab's Github page! Here you can find all software tools and analyses we have made public. 

We investigate how is movement encoded in the brain. Using the neocortex and cerebellum as model systems, our research focusses on unravelling the complex cellular and circuit mechanisms underpinning simple and skilled motor behaviours. By employing a multi-level cellular and systems neuroscience approach combining in vivo patch-clamp electrophysiology, two-photon imaging, viral-based manipulation techniques and quantitative behaviour, we aim to generate new insights into the neural computations that underlie different motor behaviours.
